                                                     Fundamental of java


1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Ans: Collection Framework is a combination of classes and interface, which is used to store and manipulate the
data in the form of objects. It provides various classes such as ArrayList, Vector, Stack, and HashSet, etc. and
interfaces such as List, Queue, Set, etc. for this purpose.


2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans

ArrayList
LinkedList
Arraylist uses a dynamic array
Linkedlist uses a doubly linked list.
Arraylist is not efficient for manipulation because too much is required.
Linked list is efficient for manipulation
Arraylist better to store and fetch data
Linkedlist  is better to manipulate data
Arraylist provides random access.
Linkedlist does not provide random access
Arraylist takes less memory overhead as it stores only object.
Linkedlist takes more  memory overheads as it stores the object as well as the address of that object



3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans


Iterator
listiterator
The iterator traverse the element in the forward direction only .
Listiterator traverses the elements in backward and forward direction both.
The iterator can be used in list, set,and queue
Listiterator can be used in list only
The iterator can only perform a remove operation while traversing the collection. 
Listiterator can perform , add, Remove and set operation while traversing the collection.



4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans

Iterator 
enumeration
The iterator can traverse legacy  and non-legacy elements.
Enumeration can traverse only legacy elements
The iterator is fail-fast
Enumeration is not fail-fast
The iterator is slower than enumeration.
Enumeration is faster than iterator
The iterator can perform a remove operation while traversing the collection
The enumeration can perform only traverse operations on the collection



5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans: The List and Set both extend the collection interface. However, there are some differences between the two
which are listed below
o The List can contain duplicate elements whereas Set includes unique items.
o The List is an ordered collection which maintains the insertion order whereas Set is an unordered collection
which does not preserve the insertion order.
o The List interface contains a single legacy class which is Vector class whereas the Set interface does not
have any legacy class.
o The List interface can allow a number of null values whereas Set interface only allows a single null value.



6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans: Both HashSet and TreeSet are implementations of the Set interface in 2ava, but they have some
differences in terms of their properties and usage1
o Ordering: HashSet is an unordered collection of elements, while TreeSet is a sorted set of elements based on
their natural order or a custom comparator.
o Duplication: HashSet does not allow duplicate elements, while TreeSet does not allow duplicates as well.

o Implementation: HashSet is implemented using a hash table, while TreeSet is implemented using a self-
balancing binary search tree (Red-Black tree).

o Performance: HashSet has constant-time complexity O(1) for adding, removing, and testing the existence of

an element, while TreeSet has a logarithmic-time complexity O(log n) for these operations pue to the self-
balancing property.

o Memory usage: HashSet uses less memory than TreeSet because it only stores the elements, while TreeSet
stores additional information for maintaining the orper@
o Iteration: HashSet provides no guarantees regarding the order of iteration, while TreeSet guarantees the
elements are iterate in sorted orper@
o Usage: HashSet is suitable when ordering is not important, and fast access and membership tests are
Needed A TreeSet is suitable when elements need to be sorted or accessed in a specific order.


7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Both arrays and ArrayLists are used to store collections of elements in java, but they have some
differences in terms of their properties and usage.
o Type: Arrays can store elements of primitive data types as well as objects, while ArrayList can only store
objects.
o Size: The size of an array is fixed once it is created, while the size of an ArrayList can be dynamically
increased or decreased by adding or removing elements.
o Mutability: Arrays are mutable, meaning that you can modify the elements in an array after it has been
Created A ArrayList is also mutable, but the only way to modify it is by adding, removing or modifying
elements.
o Performance: Arrays have better performance than ArrayLists for certain operations, such as accessing
elements by index, because they are implemented as a continuous block of memoryA ArrayLists, on the other
hand, use dynamic memory allocation anp are implemented as a dynamic array, which may result in more
memory overhead and slower performance for certain operations@
o Methods: Arrays have a limited set of methods compared to ArrayLists, which provides more methods for
manipulating the collection, such as adding, removing, and sorting elements.


 Initialization: Arrays can be initialized with values at the time of creation, while ArrayList requires the use of
methods to add elements to the collection.
 Compatibility: Arrays are compatible with traditional for-loops and can be easily passed to other methods,
while ArrayList requires
